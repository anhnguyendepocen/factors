\begin{abstract}
\noindent The objective of this document is to describe a step-by-step methodology to extract factors, or underlying latent variables, from a set of observed measures. Factor analysis is arbitrary by construction. Thus, I intend to provide the exact steps for factor analyzing a set of measures and elect a consistent way of being arbitrary. The theoretical fundamentals of this document come from \citet{gorsuch1983factor}. Although this author (or any other author) does not suggest any method over the other, I justify why the method I elect is simple and transparent. Finally, I provide implementations in Python and Stata in separate files.
